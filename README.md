### Description

This is the source code for a textbox that has an hDC handle! ***THIS IS NOT A LABEL*** This means that you can paint a picture / skin onto it, thus simulating transparency . . .or whatever you want it to look like. My textbox supports ALMOST EVERY function that a MS-textbox supports . .including selection of text, jumping to words and scrolling. ***PLEASE TAKE A LOOK*** Included in this code-download is also my newest 'low-memory' version of transparent buttons, which is a class-module that automates on-the-fly skinning of command buttons. A MUST SEE!
